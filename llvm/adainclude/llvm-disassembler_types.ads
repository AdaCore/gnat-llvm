  --*
  -- * The type for the operand information call back function.  This is called to
  -- * get the symbolic information for an operand of an instruction.  Typically
  -- * this is from the relocation information, symbol table, etc.  That block of
  -- * information is saved when the disassembler context is created and passed to
  -- * the call back in the DisInfo parameter.  The instruction containing operand
  -- * is at the PC parameter.  For some instruction sets, there can be more than
  -- * one operand with symbolic information.  To determine the symbolic operand
  -- * information for each operand, the bytes for the specific operand in the
  -- * instruction are specified by the Offset parameter and its byte widith is the
  -- * size parameter.  For instructions sets with fixed widths and one symbolic
  -- * operand per instruction, the Offset parameter will be zero and Size parameter
  -- * will be the instruction width.  The information is returned in TagBuf and is
  -- * Triple specific with its specific information defined by the value of
  -- * TagType for that Triple.  If symbolic information is returned the function
  -- * returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

  --*
  -- * The initial support in LLVM MC for the most general form of a relocatable
  -- * expression is "AddSymbol - SubtractSymbol + Offset".  For some Darwin targets
  -- * this full form is encoded in the relocation information so that AddSymbol and
  -- * SubtractSymbol can be link edited independent of each other.  Many other
  -- * platforms only allow a relocatable expression of the form AddSymbol + Offset
  -- * to be encoded.
  -- *
  -- * The LLVMOpInfoCallback() for the TagType value of 1 uses the struct
  -- * LLVMOpInfo1.  The value of the relocatable expression for the operand,
  -- * including any PC adjustment, is passed in to the call back in the Value
  -- * field.  The symbolic information about the operand is returned using all
  -- * the fields of the structure with the Offset of the relocatable expression
  -- * returned in the Value field.  It is possible that some symbols in the
  -- * relocatable expression were assembly temporary symbols, for example
  -- * "Ldata - LpicBase + constant", and only the Values of the symbols without
  -- * symbol names are present in the relocation information.  The VariantKind
  -- * type is one of the Target specific #defines below and is used to print
  -- * operands like "_foo@GOT", ":lower16:_foo", etc.
